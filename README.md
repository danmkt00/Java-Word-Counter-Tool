📘 Word Counter

This Java program reads a text file and counts the number of lines, words, and characters it contains.
It uses Java’s built-in file handling and string processing features to analyze the file efficiently.

⚙️ How It Works

Reads the file line by line using a BufferedReader.

Counts each line, splits words using whitespace (\\s+), and sums up characters.

Displays the total number of lines, words, and characters after processing.
